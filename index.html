    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Access to dermatological care remains a significant concern for patients across the world, and artificial intelligence (AI) tools have shown promise in assisting with triage, non-specialist diagnosis, and augmentation of specialist workflow, with several models approved or on the way to approval in the United States and European Union. Concern exists regarding the representation of patients with darker skin tones within publicly-available datasets, and studies have suggested that some computer vision-based diagnostic AI models may perform worse on photos of skin of color. </p><br>
    <br>
    <p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
    <p>Our group previously released the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset, a real-world retrospective collection of Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) I-VI images, and demonstrated that disparities in performance on darker skin tones were reduced following fine-tuning on DDI images. However, the DDI dataset did not include photos from Asian patients. A 2021 review of 70 studies on AI in dermatology found a gap in the availability of public datasets representing Asian skin: of the eleven studies trained on datasets that included Asian patients, most were private data collections with no FST breakdown (7/11, 64%). The remaining four studies, which also did not include FST, had limited availability, did not provide a more detailed breakdown of ethnicity beyond “Asian”, and were mostly from South Korea. Heterogeneity in health outcomes within the Asian demographic has been recognized, especially within the Asian American community. Thus, we present the DDI-2 dataset, the first publicly available, histopathologically-confirmed, real-world dataset of photos from self-identified Asian patients residing in the U.S., along with a detailed breakdown of FST and sub-ethnicity whenever available.
</p><br>
    <br>
    <p><b>Clinical application:</b> Patients of color disproportionately face access barriers to dermatology and would benefit from proposed AI use cases for triage and clinical decision support. Furthermore, some clinicians may have less experience evaluating conditions presenting in skin of color, a predisposition that can be exacerbated by AI tools not sufficiently trained on skin of color. Thus, wider availability of well-labeled, realistic photos across diverse skin tones is crucial to mitigate potential inequity in algorithm development and can provide a tool for benchmarking performance across different populations.
 </p>
    <br>
    <p><h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
    <p> DDI-2 comprises a retrospective convenience sample of 665 photos (mostly lesions [74.7%] rather than rashes [23.3%]) corresponding to 169 unique diagnoses from 550 patients who were seen at an academic medical center dermatology department from 2012-2022, and contains granular annotation of Fitzpatrick skin type, anatomical site, histopathologically-confirmed diagnoses, and annotation of artifacts associated with routine clinical workflows such as the presence of surgical markings or ruler. Each field was manually confirmed by a senior dermatology fellow with four years of dermatology training and a board-certified dermatologist with seven years of experience following board certification. Further details can be found in our paper. </p><br>  
    <p>Further description of the dataset is available in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R0tjRpfl9r3q8XLdHndIqId9JiPbwe1EI9c1H_WXxqg/edit?usp=sharing">datasheet</a>.</p>
